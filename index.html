          South Korea, the country pictured has one of the lowest birth rates in the world. On the surface this may seem incredible for society, less children means more free
          leisure for adults and less strain on earths resources. But this common view continually avoids mentioning the incomprehensible impact demographics has on
          the neverending gears of economics. Going back to South Korea and you see one of the most advanced countries in the world with sprawling cyber cities and skyscrapers,
          its infrastructure is ranked one of the best in the world and its university enrollment rate is touching 70%, One may presume that Young South Koreans have a incredibly bright
          future ahead of them but when you start peeling back the facade of prosperity, you get a dire situation spirally out of control and one that will soon start to effect every
          advanced country.

      <p> This is of course the stage 4 of the demographic model which states that as countries aproach certain levels of education the birth rate falls below the death
          rate and we see an extreme example of this with South Korea which at 1.19 birth per woman falls well below the 2.1 replacement rate. The consequences of this are numerous and
          will effect every young person living in a similarly advanced economy. The median age is now 42 and will increase to 54 by 2050, this is a radical difference from 22 y/o in 1980.
          This young workforce in the 80's which was the engine for the economic expansion which turned the agricultural leper of the world into a manafacturing behemoth that was once cited
          as " The Germany of Asia " is now nearing retirement and with that a mammoth of a problem for the Korean societal fabric.</p>
    <p>However not all of this is doom or gloom. The predictions above depend on the fact that greater population is an asset not a liabilty
      which it has been historically and presently. This could change in the near future depending on the rate and success of higher level automation.</p>

      <p>The other viewpoint comes from a galatic standpoint, if we could succesfully colonise other planets within the solar system then resources would
      no longer be a problem. The rate of innovation that would come with having an enourmous population all thoughout the solar system is mind boggling to
    comprehend, think of hundreds of millions of engineers collabarating together. No problem would be to large wo solve and humanity could start to focus
  on creating a proper utopian society.</p>
